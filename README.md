💜 Curated by [Hazel Kennedy](https://linktr.ee/dawdledoodles) 💜

Got resources you’d like to see on this list? Notice a broken link? Email me, shoot me a DM, or make a pull request and I’ll get to it!  I’m always open to chat as well - don’t be shy ^^

Disclaimer: I’m a technical artist and gameplay programmer, so there’s more resources for those roles.


#### Key:

🟪 Purple Resources are “most useful” links. These include highly influential courses/books, resources I’ve personally found invaluable, and other entire mega-lists.
